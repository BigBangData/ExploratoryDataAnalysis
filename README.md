# ExploratoryDataAnalysis

Repository containing the second course project for 'Exploratory Data Analsysis' - course 4 in the Johns Hopkins University's 'Data Science' Specialization in Coursera. 


## Air Quality Function:

After the course, I decided to look at PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions all over the U.S. I created the *AirQuality* function to speed up the EDA. For a given county, *AirQuality()* spits out 4 scatter plots covering the last decade (years 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) of emissions monitoring of fine particulate matter (2.5 Âµg/m3).
