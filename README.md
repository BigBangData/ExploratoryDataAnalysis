# Exploratory Data Analysis - Additional Materials

This is a repo containing work related to exploratory data analysis. I created it after taking [Course 4: 'Exploratory Data Analsysis'](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis), in the 'Data Science Specialization' from Johns Hopkins University (Coursera).

## Air Quality Function

Deciding to further explore PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions in my community and throughout the U.S., I created the *AirQuality* function to speed up the EDA. For a given county, *AirQuality()* spits out 4 scatter plots covering the last decade (years 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) of emissions monitoring of fine particulate matter (2.5 Âµg/m3). Please find a thorough description of the work in the sub-folder **AirQuality Function**.
